#### Peranan saya
Saya bertugas di bagian koding. Teman-teman saya memberikan outline design dan isi konten. Sisanya saya yang buat. Seperti peletakan, font, animasi CSS, dan lainnya yang berhubungan dengan koding dan design. Kami hanya melakukan low-fidelity prototyping. Saya menentukan warna, font, dan bagian design lainnya sambil saya mengerjakan kodingannya.<br><br>
Kesulitan yang dihadapi adalah tentu saja penentuan color scheme, tata letak, dan kendala teknis (coding). Untuk masalah color scheme, saya hanya mencoba mencari warna yang cocok dan kontras saja dengan background image. Sebagian besar teks berwarna putih karena saya membuat background image menjadi sedikit gelap. Untuk masalah tata letak, saya mencoba menonton video dan mencari di google. Di saat itulah saya mengetahui mengenai CSS Flexbox yang saya langsung terapkan pada saat itu juga. Untuk masalah koding seperti bagaimana membuat website responsif, mengapa hasil akhir tidak sesuai yang ada di pikiran, dan lain-lain, saya mencoba mencari dari google dan mengotak-atik kodingan saya sendiri.
